# Hi — I'm Bibou1494

Hey! I'm a hobbyist developer who loves video games (osu!, Minecraft) and coding. I build small bots and websites for fun and learning.

## About me
- I like exploring ideas and building small projects.
- I'm a "vibe coder": I enjoy prototyping and learning by doing.
- I try to write code thoughtfully and to learn where AI helps and where I should rely on my own understanding.

## Projects
- osu! bot — A bot for osu! (status: down / archived).  
- Telegram bot — Small bot project (status: down / archived).  
- Discord bot — Built a bot for Discord (status: active).  
- Website — A personal/project website (status: down / archived).

If you'd like details or code for any project, ask — I can share code snippets or bring something back up.

## What I love
I love video games, coding, and figuring out my dumb mistakes. Debugging is how I learn best.

## About AI and my code
I use AI tools as assistants (for ideas and suggestions), but I try to understand and review everything myself. If I use an AI-generated snippet, I make sure I understand it and adapt it.
